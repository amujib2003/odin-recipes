        Chocolate chip cookies is a desert you can't go wrong with. It melts in your mouth and pairs great with a cup of milk.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (1/2 lb.) butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups firmly packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (12 0z.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter and brown sugar until well blended. Beat in eggs and vanilla until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, mix flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir or beat into butter mixture until well incorporated. Stir in chocolate chips and pecans, if using.</li>
            <li>Drop dough in 2-tablespoon (1/8-cup) portions, 2 inches apart, onto buttered 12- by 15-inch baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in a 400Â° oven until cookies are lightly browned and no longer wet in the center (break one open to check), 6 to 8 minutes; if baking more than one pan at a time, switch pan positions halfway through baking.</li>
            <li>With a wide spatula, transfer cookies to racks to cool. If hot cookies start to break, slide a thin spatula under them to release; let stand on pan to firm up, 2 to 5 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
