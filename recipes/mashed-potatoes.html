        <h2>Description</h2>
        This recipe makes 6 cups of creamy mashed potatoes and it only takes about 40 minutes.
        There aren't many ingredients either and a lot of them you'll be able to find at home.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese,softened</li>
            <li>3.4 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel, Boil & Drain. Peel potatoes, and cut into 1-inch pieces. Bring potatoes, 1 tsp. salt, and cold water to cover to a boil in a medium-size Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook 16 to 20 minutes or until fork-tender; drain.</li>
            <li>Add Creamy Richness. Return potatoes to Dutch oven. Cook until water evaporates and potatoes look dry. Mound potatoes on 1 side; add butter, next 3 ingredients, and remaining 1 tsp. salt to opposite side of Dutch oven. Cook 1 to 2 minutes or until butter is melted and mixture boils.</li>
            <li>Beat Until Smooth. Remove from heat; beat at medium speed with a hand-held electric mixer 30 seconds to 1 minute or to desired degree of smoothness. (Do not overbeat.) Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
